Greetings Sir,

This project contains three folders, MainFrame, Jar file and Database Files. 

1.Main Frame folder should be opened in the Netbeans IDE for the execution of the project.

2. Jar file folder contains jar file as well as .class files. In order to execute the jar fie, you need
to place this folder directly inside C directory in order for some images to load.

3. Database Files folder contains all the database files that we have used in the project.


Suggestion: 
	Kindly execute this project by opening MainFrame folder in Netbeans IDE.
